This is a rails repository that connects users to whiskeys with a join table. users can search for whiskeys by name or id, GET all whiskeys, update whiskeys, add whiskeys, and delete whiskeys.

Coming soon: users can save whiskeys, and only delete whiskeys they have saved. users with permissions can update whiskeys. users will still be able to create whiskeys.
